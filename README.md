# **Hat**

## _Hackers Toolbox_

_Removes the need to re-create scripts and do repetitive tasks. Just focus on hacking!_

________

## **Currently included tools:**

* ### _**Dictator**_

  * A dictionary generator for brute forcing attacks!
  * Configs to repeat or don't certain words to cut down on time and size (in a future update).
  * [Currently only works on Windows]

* ### _**Social Buster**_

  * Need to search for someone without an exact username?
  * Want to automate looking for users from an API, without having to deal with all of that annoyance?
  * Want information about social media accounts neatly wrapped into a JSON?
  * _Social buster can do all of that!_
  * Uses the core of Dictator to generate lists of user data, with the same configs available (in a future update).
  * Interacts with the APIs or sometimes just brute forces GET requests to check for validity of users and if so, information about said user.
  * [Needs the finished version of Dictator]

* ### _**Hexagon**_

  * A software core with support for encrypting and decrypting many forms of encoded data, including normal Strings, Ascii, Binary, Hexadecimal, Base64, and Morse code.
  * Has options for different sizes for each (for example two digit hexadecimal or 8 bit binary) with tweakable configs.
  * Can be capable of making some encryptions unreversable but consistant, so you can use it as a weaker hashing algorithm. (Not recommended as it can be easily brute forced, ironically using tools from this app itself, lol)
  * [Not Started]

* ### _**Hecktor**_

  * Explore executables, object code, compiled files, encrypted data and all else unreadable data in a nice format, including support for Hexadecimal, Binary, Ascii, or a combination of them!
  * Uses the core of Hexagon to provide support for encryption of file data.
  * Settings can be tweaked to do almost everything Hexagon can do. (Not recommended to hash your files by accident!)
  * [Needs the finished version of Hexagon]

* ### _**Versteckt**_

  * Encrypt your data!
  * Uses the core from Hecktor, and will encrypt all forms of media you feed it with whatever encryptions you select for it!
  * [In the future will support adding keys to make it impossible to decrypt without said key]
  * A method to get around censorship, detection software, and other filters on your freedom. You can trade information and easily encrypt and decrypt it with just a few clicks!
  * You can use it's core to create a more secure client modifications for your platform of choice. (Credit this repository if you do!)
  * [Needs Hecktor to be finished]

* ### _**Quackenbirdt**_

  * A toolbox for RubberDucky tasks
  * Will contain a DuckyScript generator
  * WIll contain some pre-made Ducky scripts to do a few general tasks or to use as boilerplate
  * [Not Started]

* ### _**Knock Knock!**_

  * Who's there? Why not check it out yourself! "Knock Knock" will (try to) open any file in any format and try to make it viewable for you.
  * There will be a future update to automatically give information about the file type opened.
  * Uses the cores of Hexagon, and expands upon them by actually trying to understand what it's trying to read.
  * [Needs the finished version of Hexagon]

* ### _[These are all of our currently planned apps.]_

* Hat will have it's own special folder where apps with configs can read pre-made config files from and apps that output data will save them there.

________

## _Once everything is finished, they'll be combined into the main Top Hat, containing all and offering the best user tools, with a great feeling GUI!_

________

## _**Warning:**_

* ## Do not use these tools for malicious purposes

* ## Do not use decryptors and binary explorers on data that's not supposed to be revealed

* ## Do not use encryptors on data you do not own, as it could lead to accidental loss of important data

* ## Do not spam tools that ping servers, as they could cause accidental damage and server abuse. (Abusing online servers can also get you banned from using them)

### _**Anyone working on this project is not responsible if do anything unlawful, don't break these rules!**_

Thank you, have fun ethical hacking!
