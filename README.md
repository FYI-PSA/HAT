## _**Hackers Toolbox**_

_A Set of tools made to remove the tediousness of pentesting, spend more time on the fun parts!_

________

## **Currently included tools:**

* ### _**Dictator**_

  * A dictionary generator for web crawlers and brute forcing!
  * Configs: Configure things such as file name and extension, prefix and suffix.
  * You can also set some details that the program normally asks you to automate the process and be more efficient
  * [Works on Linux,

  ### _**[Intall and Instructions](/Dictator/Instructions.md)**_

________

## **Currently in prototyping tools:**

* ### _**Clacker**_

  * A simple keylogger.
  * Can be toggled on and off or restarted.
  * Shows logged data live in it's console, but will be able to save a session to a file. (You can change the location)
  * [In prototyping...]

* ### _**Versteckt**_

  * Uses the RSA algorithm alongside some other obfuscaton methods to encrypt your data!
  * Accepts all forms of media including text, pictures, videos, audio and more!
  * A method of bypassing content checks, cencorship and filtering! (Please still be careful! <3 )
  * [Will have Android, Windows, Linux and Mac support]
  * [In prototyping...]

* ### _**Quackenbirdt**_

  * A toolbox for RubberDucky tasks
  * Will contain a DuckyScript generator
  * WIll contain some pre-made Ducky scripts to do a few general tasks or to use as boilerplate
  * [Not public]

________

## **Future Projects:**

* ### _**Social Buster**_

  * Need to search for someone without an exact username?
  * Want to automate looking for users from an API, without having to deal with all of that annoyance?
  * Want information about social media accounts neatly wrapped into a JSON?
  * _Social buster can do all of that!_
  * Uses the core of Dictator to generate lists of user data, with the same configs available (in a future update).
  * Interacts with the APIs or sometimes just brute forces GET requests to check for validity of users and if so, information about said user.

* ### _**Hecktor**_

  * Explore executables, object code, compiled files, encrypted data and all else unreadable data in a nice format, including support for Hexadecimal, Binary, Ascii, or a combination of them!
  * Uses the core of Hexagon to provide support for encryption of file data.
  * Settings can be tweaked to do almost everything Hexagon can do. (Not recommended to hash your files by accident!)
  * [Needs the finished version of Hexagon]

________

* ### The release versions of all tools will be written in a compiled language [e.g. C/C++/Rust], unless needing to be otherwise [e.g. Android releases] 

________

## _**Warning:**_

* ## Do not use these tools for malicious purposes

* ## Do not use decryptors and binary explorers on data that's not supposed to be revealed

* ## Do not use encryptors on data you do not own, as it could lead to accidental loss of important data

* ## Do not spam tools that ping servers, as they could cause accidental damage and server abuse. (Abusing online servers can also get you banned from using them)

### _**Anyone working on this project is not responsible if do anything unlawful, don't break these rules!**_
