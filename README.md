## _**Hackers Toolbox**_


_A Set of tools made to remove the tediousness of pentesting, spend more time on the fun parts!_

________

## **Currently included tools:**

* ### _**Dictator**_

  * A dictionary generator for web crawlers and brute forcing!
  * Configs: Configure things such as file name and extension, prefix and suffix.
  * You can also set some details that the program normally asks you to automate the process and be more efficient
  * [Works on Linux, MacOS, Windows]

  ### _**[Intall and Instructions](/Dictator/Instructions.md)**_

________

## **Currently in prototyping tools:**

* ### _**Clacker**_

  * A simple keylogger.
  * Can be toggled on and off or restarted.
  * Shows logged data live in it's console, but will be able to save a session to a file. (You can change the location)
  * [In prototyping...]

* ### _**Versteckt**_

  * Uses the RSA algorithm alongside some other obfuscaton methods to encrypt your data!
  * Accepts all forms of media including text, pictures, videos, audio and more!
  * A method of bypassing content checks, cencorship and filtering! (Please still be careful! <3 )
  * [Will have Android, Windows, Linux and Mac support]
  * [In prototyping...]

* ### _**Quackenbirdt**_

  * A toolbox for RubberDucky tasks
  * Will contain a DuckyScript generator
  * WIll contain some pre-made Ducky scripts to do a few general tasks or to use as boilerplate
  * [Not public]

________

## **Future Projects:**

* ### _**Social Buster**_

  * Checks for valid social media accounts using small amounts of information to guess their usernames.

* ### _**Hecktor**_

  * Explore normally unreadable files and look deeper into the compiled instructions and binaries.

________

* ### The release versions of all tools will be written in a compiled language [e.g. C/C++/Rust], unless needing to be otherwise [e.g. Android releases] 

________

## _**Warning:**_

* ## Do not use these tools for malicious purposes

* ## Do not use decryptors and binary explorers on data that's not supposed to be revealed

* ## Do not use encryptors on data you do not own, as it could lead to accidental loss of important data

* ## Do not spam tools that ping servers, as they could cause accidental damage and server abuse. (Abusing online servers can also get you banned from using them)

### _**Anyone working on this project is not responsible if do anything unlawful, don't break these rules!**_
