# **Hat**

## *Hackers Toolbox*

Removes the need to re-create scripts and do repetitive tasks. Just focus on hacking!

________

## **Currently included tools:**

* ### ***Dictator*** [(Version 0.98)](https://github.com/Funtime-UwU/HAT/releases/tag/Stable-Release)

  * A dictionary generator for brute forcing attacks!
  * Configs to repeat or don't certain words to cut down on time and size (in a future update).
  * [See how it works](/Dictator/Algorithm.md)
  * [Currently only works on Windows]

* ### ***Social Buster*** [(In early prototyping)](https://github.com/Funtime-UwU/HAT/tree/Live-Development)

  * Need to search for someone without an exact username?
  * Want to automate looking for users from an API, without having to deal with all of that annoyance?
  * Want information about social media accounts neatly wrapped into a JSON?
  * *Social buster can do all of that!*
  * Uses the core of Dictator to generate lists of user data, with the same configs available (in a future update).
  * Interacts with the APIs or sometimes just brute forces GET requests to check for validity of users and if so, information about said user.
  * [Not even on version 0.1 yet]

* ### ***Hecktor***

  * Explore executables, object code, compiled files, encrypted data and all else unreadable data in a nice format, including support for Hexadecimal, Binary, Ascii, or a combination of them!
  * Uses the core of Hexagon to provide support for encryption of file data.
  * Settings can be tweaked to do almost everything Hexagon can do. (Not recommended to hash your files by accident!)
  * [Not Started]

* ### ***Hexagon***

  * A software core with support for encrypting and decrypting many forms of encoded data, including normal Strings, Ascii, Binary, Hexadecimal, Base64, and Morse code.
  * Has options for different sizes for each (for example two digit hexadecimal or 8 bit binary) with tweakable configs.
  * Can be capable of making some encryptions unreversable but consistant, so you can use it as a weaker hashing algorithm. (Not recommended as it can be easily brute forced, ironically using tools from this app itself, lol)
  * [Not Started]

* ### ***Quackenbirdt***

  * A toolbox for RubberDucky tasks
  * Will contain a DuckyScript generator
  * WIll contain some pre-made Ducky scripts to do a few general tasks or to use as boilerplate
  * [README IS CURRETLY WIP]

* ### ***Knock Knock!***

  * Who's there? Why not check it out yourself! "Knock Knock" will (try to) open any file in any format and try to make it viewable for you.
  * There will be a future update to automatically give information about the file type opened.
  * Uses the cores of Hecktor and Hexagon, and expands upon them by actually trying to understand what it's trying to read.
  * [Not Started]

* ### *[These are all of our currently planned apps.]*

* Hat will have it's own special folder where apps with configs can read pre-made config files from and apps that output data will save them there.

________

## *Once everything is finished, they'll be combined into the main Top Hat, containing all and offering the best user tools, with a great feeling GUI!*

________

## ***Warning:***

* ## Do not use these tools for malicious purposes

* ## Do not use decryptors and binary explorers on data that's not supposed to be revealed

* ## Do not use encryptors on data you do not own, as it could lead to accidental loss of data or cause damage to the owner of said data and potentially their system

* ## Do not spam tools that ping servers, as they could cause accidental damage and server abuse. (May get you banned from said platform)

### ***Anyone working on this project is not responsible if do anything unlawful, don't braek these rules!***

Thank you, have fun ethical hacking!
