TODO:
 -Work with runtime args to make some things faster for experienced users
 -Add a man page for runtime args
 -(try to) Make into UI app
 -(try to) Make for mobile




TODO:
 -Automatic memory management system / Input






DONE:
 -To fix memory issue with crashing while making the list:
 --Write all content of current list to file
 --Clean up list to nothing
 --Continue writing everything back to list
 --Put in loop and ensure it gets done even if multiple memory issues occur
 ALTERNATIVE
 -Instead of writing to list, write directly to file to also lower writing time.
 POTENTIAL SOLUTION
 -Do both, on two different branches of development, see which one does better and is more preferable

 
 
 -Make a file naming system work
